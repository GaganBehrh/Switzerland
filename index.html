      <p>
        The four national languages of Switzerland are <b>German, French, Italian and Romansh</b>. German, French and Italian maintain equal status as official languages at the national level within the Federal Administration of the Swiss Confederation, while Romansh is used in dealings with people who speak it.In 2017, 62.6% of the population of Switzerland were native speakers of German (58.5% spoke Swiss German and 11.1% Standard German at home); 22.9% French (mostly Swiss French, but including some Franco-Provençal dialects); 8.2% Italian (mostly Swiss Italian, but including Lombard dialects); and 0.5% Romansh.[6] The German region (Deutschschweiz) is roughly in the east, north and centre; the French part (la Romandie) in the west and the Italian area (Svizzera italiana) in the south. There remains a small Romansh-speaking native population in Grisons in the east. The cantons of Fribourg, Bern and Valais are officially bilingual; Grisons is officially trilingual.

        <p>Where do we start first? Switzerland has 26 cantons, so it’s no surprise that you will find so many choices in traditional Swiss food. However, let’s check 10 out of the most famous ones among them.</p>

        <p>Surely, the most epic cheese there is. That’s why it makes our top choice of traditional Swiss food you need to try. Fondue is a Swiss melted cheese dish served in a communal pot over a portable stove heated with a candle or spirit lamp and eaten by dipping bread into the cheese using long-stemmed forks.

The easiest recipe for Swiss fondue is mixing wine, garlic, and lemon juice in a ceramic pot over medium-low heat, or you can even use a heavy saucepan instead. Then, you add the cheese to the simmering liquid a little at a time, stirring well between each addition to ensure a smooth fondue. Sounds delicious even when explained, right? Imagine tasting it.</p>

        <p>Behold, cheese lovers. Another jaw-dropping cheesy dish of Switzerland. Raclette is a semi-hard cheese made from Alpine cow milk. Historically, it has been the main food of peasants who lived in the regions of Valais. An entire wheel of cheese would be held up in front of a fire, and as the cheese melted, it was scraped off onto a plate to be eaten. Thus, the name derives from the French word racler, meaning, to scrape. Nowadays, slices of raclette are melted and escorted with small potatoes cooked in their skin, onions, pickled gherkins, and vegetables. Raclette is often known as a Geneva traditional food choice.</p>
